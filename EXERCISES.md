# Exercises

Once the app is up and running (see [this page](README.md) for setup instructions), the real work begins :)

When doing exercises, **please do your work in branches as asked in exercises** : you can then merge tham to master, of course, if you want.


## 1 - Run unit tests
[See this page](https://github.com/bensoille/lambda-tu-exercise/blob/tu-run-exercise/EXERCISES.md)

## 2 - UT is broken
