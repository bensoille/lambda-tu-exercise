# Sync your branches

**If working in a fork**, you must synchronize exercises branches from _upstream_ repository. See _shell_ script [here](syncUpstreamBranches.sh) for details about utility script that automates this syncing.     

Simply execute synchronization with this command, when in repository root folder :
```shell
./syncUpstreamBranches.sh
```

# Exercises

Once the app is up and running (see [this page](README.md) for setup instructions), the real work begins :)

When doing exercises, **please do your work in branches as asked in exercises** : you can then merge tham to master, of course, if you want.
